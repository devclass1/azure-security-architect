# Azure Landing Zone

## **Overview**  
An **Azure Landing Zone** is a well-architected, scalable, and secure environment in Microsoft Azure that serves as a foundation for deploying cloud workloads. It follows Microsoft's best practices for governance, security, networking, and compliance, ensuring consistent and efficient cloud adoption.

## **Why Use an Azure Landing Zone?**  

### **1. Scalability & Standardization**  
- Provides a repeatable framework for deploying resources.  
- Ensures consistency across teams and projects.  

### **2. Security & Compliance**  
- Implements built-in security controls (RBAC, encryption, NSGs).  
- Helps meet regulatory standards (GDPR, HIPAA, ISO).  

### **3. Governance & Cost Management**  
- Enforces policies via **Azure Policy** and **Azure Blueprints**.  
- Uses **Management Groups** and **Subscriptions** for cost tracking.  

### **4. Network & Identity Best Practices**  
- Deploys **hub-and-spoke** or **Virtual WAN** architectures.  
- Integrates with **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** for centralized identity.  

### **5. Faster Cloud Adoption**  
- Reduces setup time for new projects.  
- Minimizes misconfiguration risks.
