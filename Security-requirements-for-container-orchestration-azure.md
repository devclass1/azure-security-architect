# Specify Security Requirements for Container Orchestration

## Introduction

Container orchestration platforms like **Kubernetes**, **Docker Swarm**, and **Apache Mesos** have become the cornerstone for managing containerized workloads at scale. These platforms automate the deployment, scaling, networking, and lifecycle of containers across a cluster of hosts. However, orchestration brings additional complexity, increasing the attack surface and requiring a well-defined set of security controls.

This document outlines the key security requirements for container orchestration platforms, particularly focusing on Kubernetes as the most widely adopted system. It covers aspects such as access control, workload isolation, secure configuration, networking, secrets management, logging, and compliance.

## 1. Cluster Access and Identity Management

### 1.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Implement Kubernetes **RBAC** to restrict user and service account actions.
- Use **Roles** and **ClusterRoles** bound to users or groups via **RoleBindings** and **ClusterRoleBindings**.
- Apply **least privilege principle**: grant only the minimum permissions required.

Example:
```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: prod
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

### 1.2 Authentication and Authorization

- Integrate with **OIDC providers** (e.g., Azure AD, Okta, Google) for identity federation.
- Avoid using static tokens or certificates for long-lived access.
- Disable anonymous access and unauthenticated endpoints.

### 1.3 Audit Logging

- Enable Kubernetes **audit logs** to capture all access attempts and actions.
- Forward logs to a central **SIEM** like Microsoft Sentinel, Splunk, or ELK stack for threat detection.

---

## 2. Secure Workload Configuration

### 2.1 Enforce Resource Limits

- Every pod should define **CPU and memory limits** to avoid noisy-neighbor issues and DoS risks.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

- Use **admission controllers** or **OPA Gatekeeper** to block deployments without resource definitions.

### 2.2 Restrict Privileged Containers

- Prevent use of containers that run as root or with elevated privileges.
- Set the `securityContext` to drop unnecessary capabilities.

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
```

- Disallow `hostNetwork`, `hostPID`, and `hostIPC` unless required.

### 2.3 Validate Configurations

- Use tools like **kube-score**, **Polaris**, or **kube-linter** to statically analyze manifests before deployment.
- Implement **CI/CD security gates** that block risky configurations.

---

## 3. Network Security and Segmentation

### 3.1 Pod-to-Pod Communication

- Apply **Network Policies** to control which pods can communicate with each other.
- Start with a **deny-all default** and allow only necessary communication paths.

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-app
  namespace: prod
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: backend
```

### 3.2 Ingress and API Server Security

- Protect the Kubernetes API server with:
  - Restricted CIDR blocks
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  - TLS enforcement

- Use **ingress controllers** (e.g., NGINX, Istio) with HTTPS and certificate management (e.g., cert-manager).

### 3.3 Service Mesh for Security

- Use a **service mesh** like Istio or Linkerd to enforce:
  - **mTLS** between services
  - **Traffic policies**
  - **Ingress/egress control**

---

## 4. Secret Management and Encryption

### 4.1 Secure Storage of Secrets

- Use native solutions like:
  - **Kubernetes Secrets** with encryption at rest
  - **External secret managers** like Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or AWS Secrets Manager

### 4.2 Avoid Secrets in Environment Variables

- Mount secrets as volumes instead of injecting them via environment variables, reducing exposure.
- Regularly rotate credentials and monitor access logs.

### 4.3 Encrypt Secrets at Rest

- Enable **KMS-based encryption** in the Kubernetes API server.
- Rotate encryption keys periodically for better security hygiene.

---

## 5. Node and Infrastructure Hardening

### 5.1 Host OS Security

- Use minimal, hardened OS distributions like:
  - **Azure Linux**, **Flatcar**, **Bottlerocket**, or **Ubuntu Minimal**
- Apply security updates automatically.
- Limit SSH access and enforce strong firewall rules.

### 5.2 Container Runtime Security

- Use **container runtimes** with support for security standards (e.g., `containerd`, `CRI-O`).
- Regularly update runtime versions to patch CVEs.

### 5.3 Node Isolation and Taints

- Use **taints and tolerations** to prevent scheduling workloads on critical nodes.
- Separate **system and user workloads** using **node pools** or **dedicated nodes**.

---

## 6. Monitoring, Logging, and Threat Detection

### 6.1 Centralized Logging

- Use tools like:
  - **Azure Monitor + Container Insights**
  - **Fluent Bit/Fluentd + Elasticsearch/Kibana**
- Capture:
  - Application logs
  - Control plane logs
  - Network and DNS logs

### 6.2 Metrics and Observability

- Implement observability stacks such as:
  - **Prometheus + Grafana**
  - **Datadog**, **New Relic**, or **Azure Monitor**

- Set up alerts for:
  - Resource exhaustion
  - Node failures
  - Unauthorized access attempts

### 6.3 Threat Detection

- Deploy runtime security tools:
  - **Falco**
  - **Sysdig Secure**
  - **Microsoft Defender for Containers**
- Detect behaviors like:
  - Shell inside container
  - Unexpected outbound connections
  - Privilege escalation attempts

---

## 7. Policy Management and Compliance

### 7.1 Admission Control

- Use built-in admission controllers:
  - `PodSecurityAdmission` (Kubernetes >=1.25)
  - `NamespaceLifecycle`, `AlwaysPullImages`, `LimitRanger`, etc.

### 7.2 Policy as Code

- Deploy **OPA Gatekeeper** or **Kyverno** for custom policies:
  - Require labels and annotations
  - Block containers running as root
  - Enforce approved image registries

### 7.3 Compliance Monitoring

- Use tools and services to meet standards like:
  - **CIS Kubernetes Benchmark**
  - **SOC 2**, **ISO 27001**, **HIPAA**, **PCI DSS**

- Run regular **compliance scans** using:
  - **Kube-Bench**
  - **Azure Policy for Kubernetes**
  - **Defender for Cloud Secure Score**

---

## 8. Supply Chain Security

### 8.1 Image Integrity and Provenance

- Use trusted base images and verify image sources.
- Scan images for CVEs using:
  - **Trivy**, **Aqua**, **Clair**, or **Defender for Containers**
- Enforce image signing (e.g., with **Cosign**, **Notary v2**).

### 8.2 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

- Generate SBOMs using tools like:
  - **Syft**
  - **SPDX**
  - **CycloneDX**

- Integrate SBOM validation into CI/CD to ensure transparency and traceability.

### 8.3 CI/CD Pipeline Security

- Secure your pipelines by:
  - Using least privilege access to registries and clusters
  - Validating IaC templates (Terraform, Helm, Kustomize)
  - Performing **static and dynamic analysis** in the pipeline

---

## 9. Backup, Disaster Recovery, and High Availability

### 9.1 Backup Strategies

- Use **Velero**, **Kasten K10**, or **Cloud-native Backup Solutions** to:
  - Backup cluster resources
  - Snapshot persistent volumes

### 9.2 Disaster Recovery Plans

- Define clear RTO/RPO for each workload tier.
- Implement **cross-region backup** and **restore testing**.

### 9.3 High Availability Setup

- Deploy control plane across multiple availability zones.
- Use multiple node pools with autoscaling and pod disruption budgets.

---

## Conclusion

Container orchestration platforms are powerful, but without the right security controls, they can become vulnerable targets. From identity and access management to workload hardening, network isolation, and runtime threat detection, every component must be secured systematically.

Organizations should adopt **policy-driven governance**, **automated threat detection**, and **compliance validation** mechanisms to maintain a secure, scalable, and resilient orchestration environment.

Security is not a one-time task but an evolving disciplineâ€”continuously validate, test, and improve your container orchestration security posture.
